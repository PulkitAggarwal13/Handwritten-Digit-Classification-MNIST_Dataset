This repository contains different approaches to perform classification tasks on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. The first approach involves using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the second approach uses Autoencoders and the third approach uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

It was observed that CNNs achieved higher accuracy on the test data compared to ANNs and Autoencoders, thus demonstrating the superiority of CNNs over other techniques, such as Autoencoders and ANNs, for image-related tasks.
